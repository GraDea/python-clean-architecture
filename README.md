Inspirations:
* Django ORM
* Clean design patterns of application by Bob Martin (Architecture the Lost Years: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkDN78P884)
* Domain Driven Development by Eric Evans
* Traits by Enthought, Inc.

* Time/space cost optimization taken as the second matter.
* Clean design and ease of lightweight testing the key fragments of code on the first place.
