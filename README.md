Inspirations:
* Django ORM
* Clean design patterns of application by Bob Martin (Architecture the Lost Years: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkDN78P884)
* Traits by Enthought, Inc.
* Domain Driven Development by Martin Fowler & Eric Evans

Spheres of consideration:
* Clean design and ease of lightweight testing the key fragments of code on the first place.
* Time/space cost optimization taken as the second matter.

Tiers of Dharma:
* Data-level logic: traits & natures, formulae.
* Domain-specific logic: entities, aggregates, value objects, shared entities (between bounded contexts), policies, factories, domain services, repositories.
* Application-specific logic: application services, gateways, CQRS stacks, sagas. Task-, event- and data-driven applications, commands.
